# What we need done
- Domain (bddy) <!-- Ayy bddy -->
- malicious subdomain solution (unassigned) <!-- manual approval? I would use a discord bot + server for that, but nonmanual is preferable -->  <!-- If it's a trending Repl, why not do it automatically? -->
- replit bot (coding398/haroon)
- front-end (conspicuous) [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/MZWlrNJagX0AwV6VkccTO1/repls.best) <!--Maybe that it shows random repls with  a subdomain on the hompage-->
- DNS STUFF AAAAAAAAAAA (haroon) <!-- should we use cloudflare? i have more experience with that - If you have more experience with that thats great!--> 
- public api maybe <!--For what then? See when someone got a domain?-->
- admin panel
- Make the docs again (were in the broken repl and weren't pushed)
