# What we need done

|:-|:-|:-|
| GET | all domains (linked + awaiting moderation) | NO |
| GET | all domains awaiting moderation | NO |
| GET | all domains that are linked | NO |
| PUT | the moderated info to true | NO |
| PUT | the moderated info to fals | NO | <!-- Why are the tables broken?????? -->




- Domain (bddy) <!-- Ayy bddy -->
- malicious subdomain solution (solution found (DC bot & webhook)) <!-- manual approval? I would use a discord bot + server for that, but nonmanual is preferable -->  <!-- If it's a trending Repl, why not do it automatically? -->
- replit bot (coding398/haroon)
- Discord bot (Raadsel, conspicuous & DillonB07)
- front-end (conspicuous) [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/MZWlrNJagX0AwV6VkccTO1/repls.best) <!--Maybe that it shows random repls with  a subdomain on the hompage-->
- DNS STUFF AAAAAAAAAAA (haroon) <!-- should we use cloudflare? i have more experience with that - If you have more experience with that thats great!--> 
- public api (raadsel & catR8kd - Done)<!--For what then? See when someone got a domain?-->
- admin panel
- Make the docs again (raadsel & catR8kd - Done)
